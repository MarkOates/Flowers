## Flowers

This is my official entry to the [TINS 2020](https://tins.amarillion.org/2020/rules) competition.

### Official Rules

* **Genre Rule**: Flowers - There should be different flowers in the game, the more the better.
* **Artistical Rule**: Make fun of old-fashioned things.
* **Technical Rule #1**: Your game must include procedural content. Bonus points if procedural generation is used to create the gameplay environment.
* **Technical Rule #2**: Some kind of special text scroller.
* **Bonus Rule**: Act of monkey - you may replace a single rule by a rule that has the opposite effect.

### About the Game

The game revolves around choosing flowers.  Offspring of flowers are procedurally generated, each mutated in some way from their parent.
As you, one-by-one, choose the flower you like the most, you explore the domain and gain achievements for discovering (creating?) new flowers.

### Implementation of the Rules

The Genre Rule (flowers) and Technical Rule #1 (procedural content) are both fulfilled by the procedural generation of flowers, which is the
primary component of the gameplay.

For the remaining requirements, I'm envoking the bonus rule, Act of Monkey, to reverse the Artistical Rule from "Make fun of old-fashioned things." to "Celebrate and cherish old-fashioned things."
During gameplay, you will be rewarded for developing and growing your flowers with positive and inspiring quotes on the topic of aging. These quotes will 
appear and disappear with a scrolling motion, fulfilling the Technical Rule #2 (scrolling text).
