## Flowers

This is my official entry to the [TINS 2020](https://tins.amarillion.org/2020/rules) competition.

### Official Rules

* **Genre Rule**: Flowers - There should be different flowers in the game, the more the better.
* **Artistical Rule**: Make fun of old-fashioned things.
* **Technical Rule #1** - Your game must include procedural content. Bonus points if procedural generation is used to create the gameplay environment.
* **Technical Rule #2** - Some kind of special text scroller.
* **Bonus Rule** - Act of monkey - you may replace a single rule by a rule that has the opposite effect.

### About the Game

The game revolves around choosing flowers.  Offspring of flowers are procedurally generated, each mutated in some way from their parent.
As you, one-by-one, choose the flower you like the most, you explore the domain and gain achievements for discovering (creating?) new flowers.

### Implementation of the Rules

The Genre Rule (flowers) and Technical Rule #1 (procedural content) are both fulfilled by the procedural generation of the flowers, which is the
primary component of the gameplay.
